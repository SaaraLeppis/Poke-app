# Pokemon App with React and Component library

This is class room project @Helsinki Business College.
Second set of learning React just started and here we use Hooks for the first time. We also use Bootstrap for styling - that's also first time.

## Whats the project about

We use poke.api to get data: picture and name of Pokemon to a card.

## Installing React Bootsrap

```shell
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3
```

## Stylesheet (required to use components)

to import latest styles, it is best to use **link** (instead of **import**)

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```
